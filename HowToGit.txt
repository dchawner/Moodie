To begin, I cloned the directory to my computer (I use Mac, FYI).

After cloning, make the local changes on your machine. Then you'll want to get them up to Github.

Because this file was new, I had to add it:
git add HowToGit.txt

After adding, I had to commit to my local repository:
git commit -am "This is a file about how to use Git... ish"

Then push your local repository to the remote one:
git push origin master
